## Description

In this WebGL project, fundamental computer graphics concepts are demonstrated within a space-themed 3D scene. The project showcases the following features:

- **Rendering multiple 3D objects** in a shared scene
- **Loading geometry data** from external files (e.g., `.obj`)
- **Animating the camera** and individual objects
- **Enabling basic user interaction** (e.g., camera controls)
- **Implementing dynamic scene lighting**
- **Applying multiple textures** to a single 3D object
- **Using environment mapping** with reflective materials
- **Displaying a video file** as a dynamic texture
